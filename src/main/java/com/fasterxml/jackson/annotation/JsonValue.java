/**
 * Marker annotation 
 * that indicates that the value of annotated accessor (either field
 * or "getter" method [a method with non-void return type, no args])
 * is to be used as the single value to serialize for the instance,
 * instead of the usual method of collecting properties of value.
 * Usually value will be of a simple scalar type
 * (String or Number), but it can be any serializable type (Collection,
 * Map or Bean).
 *<p>
 * At most one accessor of a <code>Class</code> can be annotated with this annotation;
 * if more than one is found, an exception may be thrown.
 * Also, if method signature of annotated method is not compatible with Getters,
 * an exception may be thrown (whether exception is thrown or not is an
 * implementation detail (due to filtering during introspection, some annotations
 * may be skipped) and applications should not rely on specific behavior).
 *<p>
 * A typical usage is that of annotating <code>toString()</code>
 * method so that returned String value is used as the JSON serialization;
 * and if deserialization is needed, there is matching constructor
 * or factory method annotated with {@link JsonCreator} annotation.
 *<p>
 * Boolean argument is only used so that subclasses can "disable"
 * annotation if necessary.
 *<p>
 * NOTE: when use for Java <code>enum</code>s, one additional feature is
 * that value returned by annotated method is also considered to be the
 * value to deserialize from, not just JSON String to serialize as.
 * This is possible since set of Enum values is constant and it is possible
 * to define mapping, but can not be done in general for POJO types; as such,
 * this is not used for POJO deserialization.
 *<p>
 * NOTE: When the instance is being serialized as the key of a Map type,
 * this will be ignored if an accessor is annotated with
 * {@link JsonKey}.
