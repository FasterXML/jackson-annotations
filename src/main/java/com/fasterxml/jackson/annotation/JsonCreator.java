/**
 * Marker annotation that can be used to define constructors and factory
 * methods as one to use for instantiating new instances of the associated
 * class.
 *<p>
 * NOTE: when annotating creator methods (constructors, factory methods),
 * method must either be:
 *<ul>
 * <li>Single-argument constructor/factory method without {@link JsonProperty}
 *    annotation for the argument: if so, this is so-called "delegate creator",
 *    in which case Jackson first binds JSON into type of the argument, and
 *    then calls creator. This is often used in conjunction with {@link JsonValue}
 *    (used for serialization).
 *   </li>
 * <li>Constructor/factory method where <b>every argument</b> is annotated with
 *   either {@link JsonProperty} or {@link JacksonInject}, to indicate name
 *   of property to bind to
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
 * Also note that all {@link JsonProperty} annotations must specify actual name
 * (NOT empty String for "default") unless you use one of extension modules
 * that can detect parameter name; this because default JDK versions before 8
 * have not been able to store and/or retrieve parameter names from bytecode.
 * But with JDK 8 (or using helper libraries such as Paranamer, or other JVM
 * languages like Scala or Kotlin), specifying name is optional.
 *<p>
 * One common use case is to use a delegating Creator to construct instances from
 * scalar values (like <code>java.lang.String</code>) during deserialization,
 * and serialize values using {@link JsonValue}.
 *<p>
 * NOTE: As of Jackson 2.6, use of {@link JsonProperty#required()} is supported
 * for Creator methods (but not necessarily for regular setters or fields!).
