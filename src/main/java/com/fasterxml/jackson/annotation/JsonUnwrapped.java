/**
 * Annotation used to indicate that a property should be serialized
 * "unwrapped" -- that is, if it would be serialized as JSON Object, its
 * properties are instead included as properties of its containing
 * Object -- and deserialized reproducing "missing" structure.
 * For example, consider case of POJO like:
 * 
 *<pre>
 *  public class Parent {
 *    public int age;
 *    public Name name;
 *  }
 *  public class Name {
 *    public String first, last;
 *  }
 *</pre>  
 * which would normally be serialized as follows (assuming {@code @JsonUnwrapped}
 * had no effect):
 *<pre>
 *  {
 *    "age" : 18,
 *    "name" : {
 *      "first" : "Joey",
 *      "last" : "Sixpack"
 *    }
 *  }
 *</pre>
 * can be changed to this:
 *<pre>
 *  {
 *    "age" : 18,
 *    "first" : "Joey",
 *    "last" : "Sixpack"
 *  }
 *</pre>
 * by changing Parent class to:
 *<pre>
 *  public class Parent {
 *    public int age;
 *    &#064;JsonUnwrapped
 *    public Name name;
 *  }
 *</pre>
 * Annotation can only be added to properties, and not classes, as it is contextual.
 * When values are deserialized "wrapping" is applied so that serialized output can
 * be read back in.
 *<p>
 * Also note that annotation only applies if:
 *<ul>
 * <li>Value is serialized as an Object value (can not unwrap Array values using this
 *   mechanism)
 *   </li>
 * <li>Reading/writing is done using Jackson standard {@code BeanDeserializer} /
 *  {@code BeanSerializer}; or custom deserializer/serializer MUST explicitly support similar
 *  operation.
 *   </li>
 * <li>Will not work with polymorphic type handling ("polymorphic deserialization")
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
