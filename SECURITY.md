# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In unlikely event of finding a security vulnerability directly relating to `jackson-annotations`
package -- unlikely, as there is very little code in this package --
the recommended mechanism for reporting possible security vulnerabilities follows
so-called "Coordinated Disclosure Plan" (see [definition of DCP](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Coordinated+Vulnerability+Disclosure+Guidance)
for general idea). The first step is to file a [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security):
Tidelift will route all reports via their system to maintainers of relevant package(s), and start the
process that will evaluate concern and issue possible fixes, send update notices and so on.
Note that you do not need to be a Tidelift subscriber to file a security contact.
